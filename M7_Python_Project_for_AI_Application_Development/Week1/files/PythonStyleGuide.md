# Python Style Guide

​

### `Readability counts.` This is an important point in the zen of Python.

​
​
Code is read much more often than it is written. PEP8, is a document that provides guidelines to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code.
​
Here are the most important points extracted for you:
​
​

*   Prefer Spaces no tabs for indentation.

​

*   Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

​

*   Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.

​

*   Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.

​

*   Put comments on a line of their own.

​

*   Use docstrings.

​

*   Use spaces around operators and after commas.

​

*   Name your functions and methods using `lower_case_with_underscores`.

​

*   Name your classes using `CamelCase`.

​

*   Name your constants in all capital letters with underscores separating words, like `MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE`, YEAR.
