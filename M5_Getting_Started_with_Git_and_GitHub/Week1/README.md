# Git and GitHub Fundamentals
## Introduction
Application developers rarely work alone. Large web/cloud/mobile development and data science projects will include many people – front-end developers, back-end developers, database administrators, repository administrators, and others. Every change by every contributor must be tracked and controlled to enable collaboration, accountability and version management. This type of distributed version control is extremely important when managing both small and large software projects. In this module you will learn about some of the popular version control tools, create a GitHub account and use the GitHub web interface to create a repository, add a file to it and commit your changes.

## Learning Objectives
* Define distributed version control.
* List several tools used for version control including popular Git platforms.
* Describe basic git concepts and the purpose of repositories.
* Create a GitHub account and repository.
* Add/edit files in your repo, and commit changes using the GitHub web interface.

## Module Summary
In this module, you learned that:

A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) keeps track of changes to code, regardless of where it is stored. This allows multiple users to work on the same codebase or repository, mirroring the codebase on their own computers if needed, while the distributed version control software helps manage synchronization amongst the various codebase mirrors.

Repositories are storage structures that:
* Store the code
* Track issues and changes
* Enable you to collaborate with others
* G​it is one of the most popular distributed version control systems. GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket are examples of hosted version control systems.
