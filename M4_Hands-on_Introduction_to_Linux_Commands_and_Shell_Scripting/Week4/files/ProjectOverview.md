# Linux Commands and Shell Scripting - Final Project

Estimated time needed: **90** minutes

## Introduction

Congratulations!! You have finished the modules. Now is the time to put your skills to test. Read through the scenario below.

This lab may use some bash concepts we haven't yet covered in this course. Whenever this happens, we will provide sufficient hints and/or the code for you.

## Scenario

You are a lead linux developer at the top-tech company "ABC International INC." ABC currently suffers from a huge bottleneck - each day, interns must painstakingly access encrypted password files on core servers, and backup those that were updated within the last 24-hours. This introduces human error, lowers security, and takes an unreasonable amount of work.

As ABC INC's most trusted linux developer, you have been tasked with creating a script `backup.sh` which automatically backs up any of these files that have been updated within the past 24 hours.

## Objectives

*   The objective of this lab is to incorporate much of the shell scripting you've learned over this course into a single script.
*   You will schedule your shell script to run every 24 hours using `crontab`.
*   TIP: If you're unsure whether some of your code will work as wanted, you can try the command directly in the terminal - and even create your own test scripts!
